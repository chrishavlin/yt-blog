A few of the yt developers have been experimenting with screencasts to
show off new features or demonstrate how to do some things. Sam and I
have both prepared screencasts on volume rendering and getting started
with developing, respectively. Check them out below, and please feel
free to leave comments and let us know what you think -- not just about
the screencasts, but about what they demonstrate, and if you think any
of the concepts or routines could be made easier.
