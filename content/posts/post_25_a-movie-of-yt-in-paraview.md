Jorge posted this video of using yt inside ParaView. It demonstrated
multi-res slices, projections, and even volume rendering with an
adjustable transfer function. I think it's pretty incredible. Thanks
very much to Jorge and Kitware for their hard work, and it'll be
exciting to see where it goes from here!
