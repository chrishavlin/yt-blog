In response to Matt's [post
&lt;http://blog.enzotools.org/yt-development-healpix-
and-contour-tree&gt;]() on the HEALpix rendering update, I thought it
would be worth posting an example movie. This shows the all-sky
rendering of an observer moving from the front face of a simulation
through the volume to the back face. The test simulation is 32 Mpc/h on
a side with 64^3 root grid cells and up to 4 levels of refinement. At
the start it looks like a disc because the entire simulation is in front
of the camera and by the end it is all around the sides, indicating the
simulation is behind the camera. Enjoy!
