The first yt workshop is in just about a week. We've updated the
[website](http%20://yt-project.org/workshop2012) with the current list
of talks, along with information about getting to and from the workshop
from the conference hotel, and information about how to get the sample
data. Keep your eyes on the website in the lead up to the workshop, as
we'll be posting a script for fisheye lens renderings for our viz night
at the Adler, information about the talks and example scripts, and other
useful info. Once the workshop is over we'll update with links to the
full videos of the talks, the slides, and scripts.
