Tomorrow we're going to try something new -- Google Hangouts! If you'd
like help with something, to share some feedback, or just to say hi to
other community members, stop by Tuesday, May 1st. We'll be starting up
around 2PM Eastern and continuing for a couple hours.

If this works out, we'll try it again from time to time, to catch up on
new developments, help out with scripts or visualization issues,
soliciting feedback, and to chat about using and developing yt.

You'll find the Hangout on the [yt Google Plus
page](https://plus.google.com/1969-12-31T18:00:00-00:0071834552760/posts).
