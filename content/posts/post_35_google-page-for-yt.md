yt now has a [Google Plus
page](https://plus.google.com/1969-12-31T18:00:00-00:0071834552760/).
Here's we'll post smaller, less blog-worthy items, hold video
conferencing 'hangouts', and so on. Encircle away! And if you post
something you'd like to be reshared, just be sure to explicitly share it
with '+yt' so we know.
