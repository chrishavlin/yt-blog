This is just a brief blog entry -- other news is on the way soon! -- to
let everyone know we've updated our domains. In keeping with the change
in focus of the yt project, expanding to work with multiple codes and
take broader views of analysis and visualization, we have moved from
[enzotools.org](http://enzotools.org) to
[yt-project.org](http://yt-project.org). Some other exciting changes
will be coming from this in the future, too!
