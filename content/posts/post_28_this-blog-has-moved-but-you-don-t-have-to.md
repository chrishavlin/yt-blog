In keeping with the [project
rename](http://blog.yt-project.org/were-now-the-yt-%20project) we've
moved this blog from it's old home at
[blog.enzotools.org](http://blog.enzotools.org) to its new home at
[blog.yt-project.org](http://blog.yt-project.org). But, we've put in a
few redirects, and the RSS feed hasn't moved, so you shouldn't need to
do anything different to get here. We've also enabled anonymous
commenting, so feel free to comment below. (But, of course, letting us
know who you are would certainly help with keeping in touch!)
