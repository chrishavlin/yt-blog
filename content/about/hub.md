The yt hub at https://girder.hub.yt/ has a ton of resources to check out,
whether you have yt installed or not. 

The [collections](https://girder.hub.yt/#collections) host all sorts of data
that can be loaded with yt. Some have been used in publications, and others are
used as sample frontend data for yt. Maybe there's data from your simulation
software? 

The [rafts](https://girder.hub.yt/#rafts) host the yt quickstart notebooks,
where you can interact with yt in the browser, without needing to install it
locally. Check out some of the other rafts too, like the widgyts release
notebooks -- a demo of the widgyts yt extension pacakge; or the notebooks from
the CCA workshop -- a user's workshop on using yt.
